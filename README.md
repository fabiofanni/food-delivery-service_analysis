# food-delivery-service_analysis
Explorator analysis and data visualization for a Food Delivery Service company

The goal was to provide an overview of the market, outlining potential issues and the impact to the business. I've iterated thorugh different visual solutions, from cloropleth maps to the final heatmap with pins for pick-up and delivery location.

The initial dataset provided was also inconsistent and a significant effort was devoted to normalize and clean the tables originally provided. All the analysis was performed in Python with Jupyter Notebooks.
